# Embedded-Systems-with-STM32
This repository documents my embedded systems journey through projects, from basics to complexities. I am using STM32F407G-DISC1 - Discovery kit with STM32F407VG MCU.

## 1. HelloWorld
* Controlls four LEDs (LD3, LD4, LD5, LD6) on board using the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer).

---

## 2. gpio_toggle_based_on_input
* Reads the state of PA0 using HAL.
* Depending on the state, toggles the LD3 ON or OFF.
