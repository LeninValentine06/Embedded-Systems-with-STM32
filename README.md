# Embedded-Systems-with-STM32
This repository documents my embedded systems journey through projects, from basics to complexities. I am using STM32F407G-DISC1 - Discovery kit with STM32F407VG MCU.

## HelloWorld
* Controlled four LEDs (LD3, LD4, LD5, LD6) on board using the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer).
* Learnt to use GPIO Write feature in the HAL.
